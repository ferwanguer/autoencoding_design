# Variational autoencoder applied to the generative design of NACA Airfoils
> This repo contains my work on variational autoencoders applied to generative design. For a thorough documentation on the mathematical principles of the work, it would be adequate to read : https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02102


PyQEA is an extensive research library for Quantum inspired hyper-normal based
optimization in python. 

It is intended for the solution of global optimization problems where conventional 
genetic algorithms or PSO yield un-optimal results. PyQEA supports high dimensional optimization problems
